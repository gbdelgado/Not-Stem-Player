# Not-Stem-Player
Definitely not a Donda stem player emulator that you can use [this repository](https://github.com/krystalgamer/stem-player-emulator) to get stem tracks and play them here.

## Quick Start
I'll probably end up hosting this somewhere. But for now you can run it in development mode first by doing
```
npm install
```
then
```
npm start
```
